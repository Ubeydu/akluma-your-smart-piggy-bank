How to Serve a Laravel Project on Your Local Network

Before you start, make sure you have:
Both devices (your pc/laptop and your phone/other device) connected to the same Wi-Fi network

Step 1: Find Your Local IP Address
Open your terminal and run this command:

ipconfig getifaddr en0
This returns something like: 192.168.29.247
This is your local IP address — other devices on the same network can use this to reach your system.

Step 2: Serve Laravel Using PHP’s Built-In Server
Navigate to your Laravel project root folder:

cd path/to/your-laravel-project
Then run the following command:

php -S 192.168.29.247:8080 -t public
Note:

php -S starts the built-in PHP server
192.168.29.247 is your system IP address
8080 is the port (you can use another, like 8000)
-t public tells PHP to serve files from Laravel’s public/ folder
You should now see something like:

PHP 8.x Development Server started at http://192.168.29.247:8080
Step 3: Access the App from Another Device
On your phone or another computer connected to the same Wi-Fi, open a browser and go to:
http://192.168.29.247:8080
Now your Laravel app running.

Optional: Adjust Firewall Settings (If Needed)
If you're unable to access the app from another device:

Go to System Firewall Settings
Ensure incoming connections are allowed for Terminal or PHP

# Serving a Laravel Project on Your Local Network with Laravel Sail

Since you're using Laravel Sail, the process is a bit different from using PHP's built-in server directly. Sail uses Docker containers to run your application, so let's adapt the instructions for your setup.

## Step 1: Find Your Local IP Address

Open your terminal and run this command:

```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

This returns something like: `192.168.29.247` (your actual IP will likely be different)

## Step 2: Configure Sail to Expose Your Application to the Network

By default, Sail binds to `localhost` (127.0.0.1), which means it's only accessible from your computer. To make it available on your network, you need to modify how Sail exposes ports.

You have two options:

### Option 1: Use the `APP_PORT` Environment Variable

1. Open or create the `.env` file in your Laravel project root
2. Add or modify the `APP_PORT` variable:

```
APP_PORT=8080
APP_SERVICE=laravel.test
```

3. Then, in your terminal, run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

### Option 2: Use the `--host` Flag When Starting Sail

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up --host=0.0.0.0
```

This tells Sail to bind to all available network interfaces (including your local IP address).

## Step 3: Access the App from Another Device

On your phone or another computer connected to the same Wi-Fi, open a browser and go to:

```
http://192.168.29.247:8080
```

Replace `192.168.29.247` with your actual IP address found in Step 1.

## Optional: Adjust Firewall Settings (If Needed)

If you're unable to access the app from another device:

1. Check your macOS firewall settings
2. Ensure that Docker has permission to accept incoming connections
3. You might need to add an exception for the Docker application

## Additional Tips for Sail Users

- Remember that Sail runs in Docker containers, so you're accessing the Docker container's port mapping, not PHP directly
- If you're customizing your `docker-compose.yml` file, make sure the Laravel service ports are configured with `0.0.0.0:port:port` to bind to all interfaces
- Use `./vendor/bin/sail down` to stop the server when you're done

Would you like me to check if your Sail configuration already allows for network accessibility, or do you need help with any specific part of this process?

# Security Considerations for Exposing a Laravel App to Your Local Network

Exposing your Laravel application to your local network involves some security considerations, but the risk level is generally low to moderate if managed properly and only done on a trusted network.

## Risk Assessment

Opening your application to your local network means:

1. **Local Network Access**: Anyone connected to the same Wi-Fi network can access your application
2. **Development Environment Exposure**: Development-specific debugging tools or environment variables might be accessible
3. **Database Risk**: If your local database doesn't have proper authentication, it could potentially be accessed

## Security Best Practices

If you need to do this (for testing on multiple devices, for example), here are some recommendations:

### 1. Only Do This on Trusted Networks

- Only expose your application on private, secure networks you control
- Never do this on public Wi-Fi or untrusted networks

### 2. Use Environment-Specific Protections

- Ensure your `.env` file has development-appropriate settings
- Be cautious with sensitive data in your development environment
- Consider using basic authentication if testing with sensitive features

### 3. Temporary Access

- Only expose your application when needed for testing
- Run `./vendor/bin/sail down` when you're done to stop the server

### 4. Consider Using HTTPS

- Even on local networks, if you're testing sensitive features, consider setting up a local SSL certificate

## Safer Alternatives

If you're concerned about security:

1. **Use Laravel Valet Plus or Expose**: These tools can create secure tunnels for testing
2. **Consider Local Device Simulators**: For many testing scenarios, browser device mode can be sufficient

## Conclusion

Exposing your Laravel application to your local network for testing is a common practice during development and is generally safe on trusted networks when following the precautions above. The main risks come from who else is on your network and what data/features your application exposes.

If you're working on something with sensitive data (like the financial data suggested by the migration file you have open), you should be extra cautious and possibly consider more isolated testing approaches.
